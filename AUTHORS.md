Bruce's core implementation was written by
[Dave Peterson](https://github.com/dspeterson).  Bruce also contains code
written by former Tagged/if(we) employees who worked on the
[Stig Database Project](http://www.stigdb.org/).  These contributors include
[Jason Lucas](https://github.com/jasonl9000),
[Joris Van Remoortere](https://github.com/jmlvanre),
[Cody Maloney](https://github.com/cmaloney),
[Michael Park](https://github.com/mpark),
[Chris Tidder](https://github.com/ctidder),

The former Stig Team has since formed its own company, OrlyAtomics, which was
acquired by [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com).  Additional contributors
include [Omid Aladini](https://github.com/omidaladini).
